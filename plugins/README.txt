This directory is for open-source scripts that will be occasionally updated 
with git subtree

============================

scssphp:
	Compiles scss files on the fly, which should make on-the-fly 
	server edits to sites much much easier. 

	To update in the repo (while in the root of the theme directory)

	git subtree pull --prefix library/scssphp https://github.com/leafo/scssphp.git master --squash



ns-disclaimer:
	OK, this is not in this directly, but in 
	/plugins/ns-disclaimer

	I wanted a place to save this line though, so here it is. 

 	git subtree pull --prefix /plugins/ns-disclaimer git@bitbucket.org:northstreetcreative/ns-disclaimer.git master --squash


disable-plugins:
	Applies to most standard site, as well as prox sites, so located here: 
	/plugins/disable-plugins

	I wanted a place to save this line though, so here it is. 

 	git subtree pull --prefix plugins/disable-comments https://github.com/solarissmoke/disable-comments.git master --squash
